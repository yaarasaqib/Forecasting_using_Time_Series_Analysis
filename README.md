# STAMATIC Time Series Analysis Project

## Introduction

STAMATIC is a time series analysis project that aims to analyze and predict air pollutant levels in a coal mining region. The project focuses on the impact of coal open pit blasting on air quality and the environment. By leveraging time series data, this project aims to gain insights into pollutant levels during blasting periods and explore potential mitigation strategies for reducing air pollution during coal mining activities.

## Features

The STAMATIC project offers the following features:

1. Data Collection: The project gathers real-time air quality data from various monitoring stations in the coal mining region. This data includes measurements of pollutants such as PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, ozone, benzene, and more.

2. Data Preprocessing: The collected time series data is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data consistency. Time series specific preprocessing techniques like interpolation and resampling are employed to clean the data.

3. Data Visualization: STAMATIC provides interactive visualizations to explore pollutant trends over time. Users can analyze pollutant levels during blasting periods and observe correlations among different pollutants.

4. Time Series Analysis: The project employs various time series analysis techniques, including decomposition, differencing, and autocorrelation analysis, to understand underlying patterns and trends in the data.

5. Predictive Modeling: STAMATIC utilizes advanced predictive modeling techniques, such as linear interpolation, cubic interpolation, and spline interpolation, to forecast pollutant levels during blasting periods.

6. Mitigation Strategies: Based on the analysis and predictions, the project suggests mitigation strategies to control and reduce air pollution during coal mining activities. Emission control measures and cleaner technologies are explored as potential solutions.

## Getting Started
